# These trade routes are generated with different distances between trades.
# The default distances of 13,37.5,42.5,76.5,105.7 ly between trades represent 
# a cross-section of the minimum 1-jump, average 2-jump, maximum 3-jump ranges
# and the minimum and average for TOTAL ranges of fully laden, fully shielded trading ships
#
# The distances used in this report are 13,37.5,42.5,76.5,105.7 ly
#
# Calculation limits
# ------------------
# 
# All trade data that is older than 30 days is not used
# Only stations where there is more than 64t of supplies are used
# However, it is assumed that your ship capacity is only 1t so that the best profit per ton for a single commodity can be calculated
# narcotics are excluded from these calculations as the price database is unreliable for these commodities and/or locations
# Starting credits assumed to be 100000Cr, so deduct that from the total to see profit
# 
# Note that there is not always extra money to be made by travelling the longer distances. Sometimes trades for longer distances will be
# identical to the trades for a shorter distance
#
# For each distance, up to two trades are shown. The first works for ANY size ship, the second for SMALL and MEDIUM ships ONLY {which can trade at outposts}
# However, sometimes the trades for the different sized ships are the same {i.e no decent trades available at outposts}
# NOTE: Trades for large ships will not appear if the source station does not allow large ships to land there
#
# WARNING: No account is taken of whether the commodities are prohibited. Use these recommendations at your peril!
